We want a service that shortens urls.

So, when a user bring to our website a long url:
"google.com/api/location/migthies/263242424?arm=205gh"

we want to give him istead a shortened version of the url, that send him to
the same link:

The short version should look like this:


localhost: 8000/abcdAB91


The short url contains a max of 8 characters after the root of the website( localhost:8000/)

The number of possibilities is (26 + 26 + 10) **8
